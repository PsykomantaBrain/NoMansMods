- Note: 
	* Sometimes, your anti-virus may detect some component of AMUMSS and block/quarantine it.
	  Be assure it is not a virus but its behavior may be interpreted as such by some anti-virus.
	* Please make sure to create an exception in your anti-virus when this happens.
	* Also a reboot may be required as some anti-virus do not correctly register the exception when it is created.

- Please execute BUILDMOD.bat once to re-create all user folders (if they do not exist)
  and download\update MBINCompiler.exe and libMBIN.dll
