NMS Modding Station

Requirements
MBINCompiler -- https://github.com/monkeyman192/MBINCompiler/releases
If you are not on Windows 10 you will need:
.NET 4.5.2 -- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642

(PSArcTool is built in)

When you first start the tool most controls will be disabled.

Begin by going to the Setup menu and got to settings to set your paths. Once all the paths are set, all the controls will be enabled.

If you don't have your game files unpacked yet there is an option in the Setup menu to do so. When you click this option find your No Man's Sky installation path and select the PCBANKS directory. Once the tool knows where your game files are it will ask you where you would like them unpacked to. Just choose or create a folder. Once this process starts it will take several minutes to complete. You can go do something else while it does it's thing.

Enjoy!
