*I will no longer be updating the mod, the way modding is structured in No Man Sky, the upkeep to maintain mods up-to-date is a hassle and takes time. Maybe they will learn from this and NMS2 will allow single lines to be edited like Skyrim. If someone wants to take it from here, be my guest.

Every time you learn a new word, no matter how, you'll learn 2, 5 or 10 words instead (depending on the file you download), including Atlas words.
It will always be that fixed amount and always from the alien race in that system.

The "You have learned the word X" events will queue up and will appear on screen one after the other, slowly. Be mindful if you intend to visit the mission board on a space station, if you queue a lot of words up and decide to accept or turn a quest, you will have to wait for all of them before getting back to the mission board menu. And if you ask an alien for directions on top of that, the menu might never show up and you'll have to ctrl-alt-del your wait out, just a heads up.
