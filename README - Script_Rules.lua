	- Advanced Script Rules / Tips
	- DEPRICATED (do not use)

	- See 'README - General Information on AMUMSS.txt' for more information about AMUMSS
	
	- NOTE: we are using LUA 5.3
		Can be used in the script:
			- All the standard lua syntax (section 3 of https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/),
			- All available standard functions in {string, math, table}
			- Also io.open, io.input, io.type, io.read, io.lines and io.close
			- And os.clock, os.date, os.difftime, os.getenv, os.time, os.tmpname
			- Plus {assert, pairs, ipairs, print, tonumber, tostring, type}

	- Some definitions/comments:
		- in this document, "==" means: "is equal to"
		- EXML files are closely related to XML files but are not the same
		- the TOP level is always <Data template="something"> AND this value is NOT used by the tool
		- Each level ends with </Property> except the TOP level which ends with </Data>
		- Every new level (SECTION) starts with a line ending in [">] (never with a line ending in [" />])
		- a SECTION is defined as "all the lines" from the beginning [">] to the ending </Property> line
			(so a SECTION is at least 3 lines long)
		- a SECTION can have one or more sub-SECTIONs

	- Generally using the "ModScriptCollection\LearningExamples\StandardSchemeExtended.lua" script
		in the ModScriptCollection\LearningExamples folder as an example.

	***** USE 'GLOBAL_INTEGER_TO_FLOAT' ONLY if you know that changing all INTEGERs to FLOAT is right
		when the math operation results in a FLOAT
	
	- Note: INTEGER_TO_FLOAT will supersede GLOBAL_INTEGER_TO_FLOAT if present

	- WARNING: even if you use this option to silence the AMUMSS WARNING/NOTICE's, MBINCompiler may still refuse
		to compile the EXML when the underlying value is 'really' an INTEGER.

	- [WARNING] ORIGINAL and NEW number value have mismatched types (INTEGER vs FLOAT or STRING vs NUMBER)
		You may see this WARNING in the REPORT. 
		This WARNING only tells you that the script is changing an INTEGER "0" to a FLOAT "0.75"
			or a STRING to a NUMBER or a NUMBER to a STRING.
		If the EXML compiles fines with MBINCompiler then it is alright, 
			otherwise it may be the case why MBINCompiler fails to compile the EXML.  
		So it is an AID to you in finding a possible problem.
	
	- can have one of these values: {nil, "", "FORCE", "PRESERVE"}

	- a member of MODIFICATIONS
	- a table of MBIN_FILE_SOURCE(s) and EXML_CHANGE_TABLE(s)
		to apply to the MBIN_FILE_SOURCE file(s)

	- the order of members is not important
	- members of MBIN_CHANGE_TABLE are:

	- is REQUIRED
	- is a member of MBIN_CHANGE_TABLE
	- alternate syntax #1: a NMS MBIN path STRING, as in [[METADATA\SIMULATION\SCENE\EXPERIENCESPAWNTABLE.MBIN]],
		- used to work on this one file

	- alternate syntax #2: a table of NMS MBIN path STRINGS,
		- as in {
				[[METADATA\SIMULATION\SOLARSYSTEM\BIOMES\BARREN\BARRENHQOBJECTSFULL.MBIN]],
				[[METADATA\SIMULATION\SOLARSYSTEM\BIOMES\BARREN\BARRENOBJECTSDEAD.MBIN]],
				[[METADATA\SIMULATION\SOLARSYSTEM\BIOMES\BARREN\BARRENOBJECTSFULL.MBIN]],

		BASED on an original NMS pak file (SPAWNDENSITYLIST.MBIN)

		Note #1: The create/rename part happens before processing the whole MBIN_FILE_SOURCE section
			- the My.GLOBALS.MBIN file will be identical to the original SPAWNDENSITYLIST.MBIN file
			- the SPAWNDENSITYLIST.MBIN file will be modified by the content of the enclosed EXML_CHANGE_TABLE
			- if you want to modify the new My.GLOBALS.MBIN file, you need to add a new section in MBIN_CHANGE_TABLE
			  with MBIN_FILE_SOURCE now referencing the new My.GLOBALS.MBIN file (see NEW_PathFilename.lua for an example of use)

		Note #2: Optional_Flag can be omitted or ""
			- if Optional_Flag is "REMOVE" then the original file ..\SPAWNDENSITYLIST.MBIN will NOT be included in the mod pak

{   >>> 'REGEXBEFORE':
	- is OPTIONAL
	- is a member of MBIN_CHANGE_TABLE
	- is a table of (two STRINGs)table(s)
	- if use, will invoque a regex utility to process the EXML file BEFORE any script processing
	- the table is of the form {{"ToFindRegex","ToReplaceRegex"},...},
		ex.: ["REGEXBEFORE"] =
						{
							{[[((.*Unknown.*)(True))]],[[\2False]]},
							...
						},
	- sed regex rules apply (see https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/)

	- is a member of MBIN_CHANGE_TABLE
	- a TABLE of tables containing some/all of the following members (table(s) and STRINGs)

	- the order of members inside the sub-table is not important
	- members of EXML_CHANGE_TABLE tables are:
		- SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS			  OPTIONAL	- a TABLE of (one or multiple) two STRINGs

}

{   >>> 'SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS':
	- is OPTIONAL
	- is a member of EXML_CHANGE_TABLE
	- a TABLE of (one or multiple) two STRINGs
	- "", or {}, or {"",}, have no effect ==> all these mean: no SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS to search (the whole file is used if nothing else selects a section)
			ex.: ["SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS"] = {"PropertyName1","value1","PropertyName2","value2",...},
			
	- {"Propertyname1","value1",}, ==> SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS pair #1
		that will be used (optionally with the PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS) to help define the SECTION
		we are looking for
	- One or more pairs can be used of the form {"Propertyname1","value1","Propertyname2","value2",...},
	- "Propertyname1","value1" defined a SECTION then "Propertyname2","value2" defined a sub-SECTION of SECTION and so on
		until the final sub-Section is found
	- "PropertynameX" and/or "valueX" can be "IGNORE" if that helps selecting the right section (use with care!)
	- "value2" here (or the last of the "values" when multiple pairs are used) can be "IGNORE" (useful in the case where NMS changes that value later)
		see the script LearnMoreWords.lua as an example...
	- If the line pointed to by the SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS pair(s) is found, it will be used by LINE_OFFSET (if any)

	- WHAT ARE CONSIDERED SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS?
		* any line with a 'Property' AND a 'value'
		* where the value is NOT ""
		* lines with a value like a filename (???.MBIN or ???.xml for example) are now accepted as SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS
			**** be warned that filenames like ???.MBIN can change more often and render your script obsolete!
		* lines with a value like 'True', 'False' or a number are now accepted as SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS
			**** be warned that these types SHOULD be used with EXTREME CAUTION, HG could easily change the value!!!
	
	- Works alone or with PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS (see OPTIONAL use below and MiningLaserSpeed.lua for example)
	- If SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS are used, they are processed BEFORE the PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS unless [PRECEDING_FIRST] = "TRUE"
}}}

{   >>> 'PRECEDING_FIRST':
	- is OPTIONAL
	- is a member of EXML_CHANGE_TABLE
	- a STRING
	- DEFAULT value is "FALSE"
	- can have one of these values: {nil, "", "TRUE", "FALSE"}
			ex.: ["PRECEDING_FIRST"] = "TRUE",
	- "TRUE" means: PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS will be processed 'before' SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS
	- nil, "" or "FALSE" means: PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS will be processed 'after' SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS (the default behavior)
}

{   >>> 'PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS':
	- is OPTIONAL
	- is a member of EXML_CHANGE_TABLE
	- a STRING or (TABLE of STRINGs)
	- "", or {}, or {"",}, have no effect ==> all these mean: no PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS to search (the whole file is used if nothing else selects a section)
	
	- {"key1","key2","key3",...}, ==> are a list of key_words inside an EXML (the 'Property name=' or  'Property value=' only)
			ex.: ["PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS"] = {"PropertyNameORPropertyValue1","PropertyNameORPropertyValue2",...},
			
	- LEVEL 0 being the whole EXML file SECTION
	- LEVEL key1, key2, ... defined sub-SECTION heads (SECTIONs) in the EXML file hierarchy (the line that ends in [">] )
	
	- Skipping one or more LEVEL can work, specially if you want to specify many sections (see REPLACE_TYPE)
	- works alone and with SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS
	
	- UNLESS used like in 'ALTERNATE USE' below, PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS are ALWAYS a LEVEL key (the line ends in [">] )
	
	- Normally, when using SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS, you use multiple PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS to further refine
		the sub-section to look for inside the SECTION defined by the SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS.
		
		If all these PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS are not found inside the SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS's SECTION, 
		the whole SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS's SECTION will be used (but your script has a problem and should be corrected)
		
	- 'ALTERNATE USE' of PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS (when SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS are processed first): 
			A single PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS can be used to try locating a particular line inside
			that previously found SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS's SECTION.
			
			The sub-SECTION containing that line then becomes the found SECTION
			
				Note: It is like using ["VALUE_CHANGE_TABLE"] = {{"Property name","IGNORE",},}, to locate a particular line
					  but leaves VALUE_CHANGE_TABLE free to be used for changing values inside the found SECTION
			
			This single PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS can be any 'name' or 'value' inside that SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS's SECTION
			(much better if UNIQUE in that SECTION)
			(see MiningLaserSpeed.lua or Multi_PAK_Multi_MBIN_Example_Mod.lua for example)

			If the single "preceding_key_word" word is not found in the SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS's SECTION,
			the whole SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS's SECTION will be used
			(but, again, you probably have a problem with you script at this point!)

********  'Simplified' example EXML with LEVELs and possible keys:
				NOTE: when NOT in 'ALTERNATE USE' (see above)
				
<Data template="GcRewardTable">               	--The LEVEL 0 key (no need to use it)
	<Property name="GenericTable">            		--a LEVEL 1 key (could be the start of a SECTION, this one has no sub-section)
	<Property value="GcGenericReward.xml">          	    --another LEVEL 1 key, start of a SECTION with sub-section(s)
		<Property name="Id" value="VEHICLE_SCAN" />   	    	--is a child, possible SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS pair, NEVER a PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS
		<Property name="Common" value="Gc...List.xml">	    --a LEVEL 2 key, start of a SECTION with sub-section(s), possible SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS pair or a PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS
			<Property name="Reward" value="GiveAll" />      	--is a child, possible SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS pair, NEVER a PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS
			<Property name="Count" value="Vector2f.xml">    --a LEVEL 3 key, start of a SECTION with a sub-section, possible SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS pair or a PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS
				<Property name="x" value="1" />			    	--is a child, NEVER a PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS
				<Property name="y" value="1" />			    	--is a child, NEVER a PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS
			</Property>									    --end of a LEVEL /3 SECTION
			<Property name="List" />                        	--is a child, NEVER a SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS or PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS
		</Property>                                   	    --end of a LEVEL /2 SECTION
	</Property>											    --end of a LEVEL /1 SECTION
</Data>                                             	    --end of LEVEL /0

******* End of 'Simplified' example

	- "key2" is allways at the same or a higher level than "key1" in the EXML file hierarchy and so on...
		if (keyi LEVEL) == x; (keyi+1 LEVEL) == x + (0 or more); (keyi+2) LEVEL == (keyi+1 LEVEL) + (0 or more); ...

	- taken together, these key_words 'always' define only one SECTION of lines inside the EXML file

	- ONLY <"start of a level"> line's <"Property name" or "Property value"> info can be used as key_words
		***** see 'ALTERNATE USE' above for "preceding_key_word" exception

	- REMEMBER: Every level starts with a line ending in [">] (never with a line ending in [" />])

	- PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS rarely define a single line in the EXML file
		but the start line of the SECTION found can be used as the base for LINE_OFFSET

	- If that is not enough to narrow down the search for the right SECTION,
		we can use a <SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS pair> to help define the SECTION we are looking for

		- These SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS are defined in SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS (see above)

		- Using NMS_REALITY_GCPRODUCTTABLE.EXML as an example:
			This EXML is madeof a big bunch of SECTIONs all starting with <Property value="GcProductData.xml">
				They are all inside the <Property name="Table"> SECTION
				So "GcProductData.xml" is NOT a good key_word to use here
				but in the next line or so there is <Property name="Id" value="CASING" /> (and some other lines)
				that can help define the SECTION where we want to make the changes to the EXML
				This is were the SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS "Id" and "CASING" come in play, we add them as SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS
				and this tool will find the line SECTION 5-81 to be where we want to make changes

			AND we can use multiple PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS or a single PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS to specify a value to look for
			inside the SECTION defined by the SPECIAL_KEY_WORDS
			(see 'ALTERNATE USE' above for PRECEDING_KEY_WORDS exception)
			(see also MiningLaserSpeed.lua or Multi_PAK_Multi_MBIN_Example_Mod.lua for example)

			- Note that you can specify as many other key_words as REQUIRED to help narrow down
				the SECTION (like "Table") in the case where this EXML file had more than
				one major SECTION ("Table" here)

{***************************  ADVANCED SCRIPT RULES / TIPS  ****************************
Tip #1:
[[-In a loop, it is much faster to use a table to store strings and do a table.concat()
	  than to concatenate strings.  As an example:

	  function UsingConcatenation() -- may take 50 sec to complete
		  local NbIteration = 200000
		  print("NbIteration = "..NbIteration)
		  local a = "MyString"
		  local b = a
		  for i=1,NbIteration do
			b = b..a
		  end
		  print(#b)
	  end

	  function UsingTable()       -- takes only less than 1 sec to complete for the same result
		  local NbIteration = 200000
		  print("NbIteration = "..NbIteration)
		  local a = "MyString"
		  local T = {}
		  T[1] = a
		  for i=1,NbIteration do
			T[#T+1] = a
		  end
		  b = table.concat(T)
		  print(#b)
	  end
]]

Tip #2:
[[-About Conflicts:
	
	Conflicts may come from the fact that a pak (from a .lua script) is already in your MODS folder 
	AND you asked AMUMSS to also check Conflicts against the MODS folder.
	
	Since AMUMSS cannot know if this pak is in fact from this .lua script 
	(the pak name could have been renamed by the user), it flags it as 'in conflict'.  
	
	But since you know this is not the case, you can safely disregard these conflicts in this case.
